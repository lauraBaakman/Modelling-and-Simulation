The parameter $K$ defines how hard the system is driven, i.e. for $K = 0$ we would expect no perturbations, this case is discussed in \cref{ss:b:trivial}. As the value of $K$ increases we expect that the chaotic regions grow and eventually start to dominate the phase space \cite{finn200Cahaotic}. The effect of varying values of $K$ is discussed in \cref{ss:b:nontrivial}. Finally \cref{ss:b:kam} discusses KAM theory and how it relates to the Chirikov map. 

\subsection{Trivial Case}
\label{ss:b:trivial}
\todo[inline]{Verwijs naar figuur \cref{fig:experiment:fancy_k:0}.}
If we choose $K = 0$ \cref{eq:chirikov} becomes:
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:chirikovK0}
	\begin{align}
		\label{eq:chirikov0:p} p_{n + 1} &= p_n \mod 1,\\
		\label{eq:chirikov0:x} x_{n + 1} &= x_n + p_{n + 1} \mod 1.
	\end{align}
\end{subequations}	
Consequently the values of $p_n$ are constant for $n > 0$, since if $p_0 = 1$, $p_1 = 0$ as a consequence of the modulo operator in \eqref{eq:chirikov0:p}. Consequently without modulo 1, $x_n$ would increase linearly, due to this operator $x_n$ is periodic. 

\Cref{fig:experiment:K0influenceOfX} shows $x_0$ as a function of $n$ for a fixed value of $p_0$, if we compare the different plots  in this figure we observe that changing $x_0$ and fixing $p_0$ only influences the phase of $x_n$, and not the period.

	}	
	\caption{$x_n$ as a function of $n$, for $p_0 = 0.4$ and varying $x$.}
	\label{fig:experiment:K0influenceOfX}
\end{figure}

Fixing $x_0$ and varying $p_0$ results in \cref{fig:experiment:K0influenceOfP}, these plots show that $p_0$ influences the periodicity of the map, that is increasing $p_0$, increases the frequency.

\subsection{Non-Trivial Case}
\label{ss:b:nontrivial}
\todo[inline]{How do the orbits change with increasing K? Do we have scenarios that are similar to period doubling?}
\Cref{fig:experiment:fancy_k} shows the influence of the chaos driving variable $K$ on randomly intialised chirikov map. As can be expected from the discussion in our previous section the map created with $K = 0$ shows only horizontal filled or dotted lines. This results from the constant value for $p_0$ and periodic changing values for $x_0$. 

By increasing $K$ with relatively small steps $0.2$ up until one, see \cref{fig:experiment:fancy_k_2} - \ref{fig:experiment:fancy_k_40}, one can clearly see the influence of this variable. With a $K = 0.2$ we can see that the constant lines are replaced by curves and ellipses in the upper, lower part and centre of phase space. From a $K = 8$ we can see even more chaotic behaviour, illustrated by $2D$ regions that are formed. Finally in the images shown in \cref{fig:experiment:fancy_k:20} - \ref{fig:experiment:fancy_k_40} we see that the $2D$ areas are more and more dominating
