	\caption{The mean, represented as points, and standard deviations, indicated by the error bars, of the ratio of the cluster size to number of sites in the grid, i.e. $(N + 1)^2$.The mean and standard deviation were calculated over $200$ runs with $p = 0.5$.}

	\caption{Mean cluster sizes, represented as points, and standard deviations, indicated by the vertical error bars, as a function of $p = 0.2, 0.21, \dotsc, 0.6$ when eight-connectivity is used. The mean and standard deviation were calculated over $200$ runs on a $41 \times 41$ grid.}
