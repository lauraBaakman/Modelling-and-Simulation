This section presents our exploration of the parameter space of the percolation model. In \cref{ss:exp:probability} we discuss the influence of the probability parameter $p$. In this section we often use the size of the cluster to explore the influence of different parameters. We have defined the cluster size as the number of sites that are occupied, note that the size of a percolating cluster is not meaningfull, since it could have grown much larger if we had not halted it. Therefore we consider the size of percolating clusters to be undefined.

\Cref{ss:exp:systemSize} explores the effect of the size of the system on the generated clusters. In \cref{ss:exp:fractal} we to determine the fractal dimension of a finite cluster. \todo[inline]{Als fractal meuk gefixt hier ook aanpassen}Finally, \cref{ss:exp:connectivity} presents a short analysis of the impact of the used connectivity.
