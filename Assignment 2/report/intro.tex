\noindent \textcite{kenzel1997physics} give the following interpretation of the percolation model; it describes the geometry of the randomly generated pores in a porous material through which only certain particles can percolate if the pores form continuous paths. The material is modeled with a square lattice. Although different lattices are possible, we consider only square lattices. 

The exact percolation model is described in \cref{s:method}, this section also presents an implementation of the model in pseudo code. In \cref{s:experiment} we discuss the experiments we have performed with the model and their results. 
% \Cref{s:conclusion} presents a summary of the findings of our experiment.
